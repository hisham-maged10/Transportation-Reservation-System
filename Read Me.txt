Bus Reservation System
----------------------

How you can use the program and what can it do?
-----------------------------------------------
In The Bus Reservation System Program
you login with your User ID and your Password To Book a Trip or to Preview your booked trips
and the user has a discount of 20% when he becomes a VIP member by booking more than 5 trips and the program also checks if there are available places for that Trip
or you login with your Manager ID and your Password to either Book a Trip with discounted price of 40% or Add Cars such as:Taxis,Trains,Buses,Mini-Buses,Limousines,MotorCycles
or Metros and you can also add a new Driver or Manager or User and the program automatically generate a unique ID for each of them separately
and in The Manager GUI you can view the List of Cars Separately due to their type and you can also view the list of Users or Employees or Managers
and there are Two Types of Trips Round and one way trips, the Round Trips cost half as much as the one way trip and also the manager
Can add new Trips to the System and it checks if there are available Cars to assign the Car to the trip
and if there isn't it will give the manager and option to add a new car to the system and also when u add a new car of any type
it will check if there is an available driver to assign to the car, if there isn't then it will give u an option to add a driver to the system
and Also the User has the option to create 
a new account using the Create Button in the login menu and has the option to join the Crew by simply choosing "Want to join our crew? Click here"
in the booking section in either the Manager window or the User menu
you choose the car type you want to travel in,then the program finds the available sources that this type of car can travel from
then when you choose a source,the program checks the Available Destinations for that Type of car and that source
then when you choose a Destination then it shows u the available Depart times for that trip and when u choose it
the return date and price and CarID are shown and then you can choose whether it is a round trip or one way trip
if it is a round trip it will divide the price to half of the price of the one way trip
and the whole program is validated externally where in the textfields the user or manager can't enter alphabits in the textfields of numbers
and in the textfields of names the user or manager can't enter numbers and in the add or delete section the user can't press the delete button or add button
without inputing all the available field.
